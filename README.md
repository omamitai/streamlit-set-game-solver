# streamlit-set-game-solver
This repository hosts a Streamlit web application that automatically identifies sets in images of Set card game layouts. Built with Python, it leverages YOLOv8 for card and shape detection and Keras models for feature classification (color, fill, shape).  Simply upload a photo of a Set game board, and the app will highlight all valid sets.
